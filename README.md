#k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classifier

This file contains code for implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier using both Euclidean distance and cosine similarity.
The classifier is implemented in Python and utilizes the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.

The code provides the following functionalities:

1. Load training and test data from Excel files.
2. Implement kNN classification using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity.
3. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score of the classifier.
4. Vary the value of k and evaluate the performance.
5. Normalize feature vectors for classification.


##Usage

1. Prepare your training and test data in Excel format.
2. Update the file paths in the code to point to your data files.
3. Adjust the parameters as needed (e.g., k value, distance metric).
4. Run the code and observe the classification results and performance metrics.


##View the results:

• The code will output the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score for both Euclidean distance and cosine similarity.
• Additionally, it will generate a plot showing the classification accuracy for different values of k using both distance metrics.
